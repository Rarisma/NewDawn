# NewDawn Engine
*Formerly Path Of A New Dawn*

### What is NewDawn?
NewDawn is a text based game engine that I have made to mostly gain C++ and some python experience as Path of A new dawn was my first real programming project, I have decided to remake it in C++ and python but impliment it in a different way as the original version is **2000+** lines long and is very repetitive.
  
### So how is NewDawn different?
NewDawn uses a file based system to load and edit rooms and it will eventually include a way to easily develop games similar to path of a new dawn as it was originally hardcoded and could easily be shortened

## What is NewDawn?
Path of a New Dawn was a project started in September 2018 and concluded in August 2019 the main focus of the project was to learn python and to develop a text based game (as I have no graphical skills).
